# DedicatedServer (WIP)

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=767516193

This Mod will auto open lobby, wait player, start the game and repeat.

###How to Change Settings?

If there is no [Settings.txt](Dedicated Server/cfg/Settings.txt), it will use Default.

Default is in [Main_Menu.lua](Dedicated Server/menu_function/Main_Menu.lua)

Delete (not clean) Settings.txt when something is wrong.
